# EWingIPSPatcher
Graphical utility for Linux to patch ROMs

graphical front end developed by Eagleheardt (2017)

original python 2.0 code was developed by Xezlec (2017) as ips.py

I used that code and packaged it in an easy to use front end (I hope)

please credit our work, if you use it

KNOWN ISSUES:
PIL may have to be purged from your library and re-added
Must have the Icon in the same folder as the .py script
