# EWingIPSPatcher
Graphical utility for Linux to patch ROMs

This is still in development!!

graphical front end developed by Eagleheardt (2017)

in the name of all that is holy, use TABS, please!!

original python 2.0 code was developed by Xezlec (2017) as ips.py

I used that code and packaged it in an easy to use front end (I hope)

please credit our work, if you use it

KNOWN ISSUES:
PIL may have to be purged from your library and re-added
**The "while True" loop where the patching is actually done does not work
    I'm not exactly sure what it's doing and need assistance fixing that. The rest of the program should work
    Xezlec's original code is in this repository as XezlecIPS.py for reference
